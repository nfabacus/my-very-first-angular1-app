# My First Angular 1 App - Getting Started

I am just playing around with Angular 1 for the first time.
I will build a very simple app using Angular 1, following "AngularJS for Everyone" by LevelUpTutorial.

## Update
14 Sept: Just got started.  Wow, two way data binding and ready-made directive!  No single line of javascript yet. But, I can do this? - Display input value instantly without page refresh.
In this case, it is even much easier than React.

20 Sept: Added basic filter.  Again it is soo easy to implement, even compared with react.
