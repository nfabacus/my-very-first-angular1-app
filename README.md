# Angular 1 App - Getting Started

I am just playing with Angular 1.
I will build a very simple app using Angular 1, following "AngularJS for Everyone" by LevelUpTutorial.

## requirements
Run the simple server in the terminal with the following command, and go to local host 8000.
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

## Update
14 Sept: Just got started.  Wow, two way data binding and ready-made directive!  No single line of javascript yet. But, I can do this? - Display input value instantly without page refresh.
In this case, it is even much easier than React.

20 Sept:
- Added basic filter.  Again it is soo easy to implement, even compared with react.
- Added my first Angular controller.
- Added a form event.
- Controller as Syntax (gets rid of $scope)
- Uses filters in Angular templates
- Conditional classes with ngClass
21 Sept:
- adds images to the list.
- adds svg with ng-include. avoid the main code becoming messy with svg code.
- adds ngAnimate
- adds UI router first time.
- creates basic directive.
